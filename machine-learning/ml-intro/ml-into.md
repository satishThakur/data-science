# Machine Learning
Traditionally only way to get computers do something has been to wirte down the algorithm which explains step wise what need to be done. Machine Learning Algorithms commonly called `Learners` are different: They figure it out on their own by making inference from data. More the data (quality data) better they get.
So in assence we do not have to program computers now they program themself!!
