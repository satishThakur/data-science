# Introduction to Machine Learning

### What is Machine learning?
Ability for computers to learn on their own without explicitly being programmed. 

Types of Machine Learning:
* Supervised Machine Learning
* Unsupervised Machine Learning

Common terminology in ML:


### Supervised Machine Learning
In supervised learning the system leans from the examples. The examples which map input X to Y (label) - using this data where we have already identified the right answer (Y or the label) the algorithm would learn to predict Y from unseen X.
In supervised learning when the goal is to predict Y (which can have infinite possible values) is called Regression. 
Few examples:
* Predicting price of a house in a location, provided data which has prices of already sold house.
When the goal is to predict Categories which are finite in number the Supervised learning is called "Classification". Note that the categories does not need to be numeric. Few examples:

* Predicting weather cancer is beneign or not based on the data.
* Spam filter - classifying email as a span or not.
* Content moderation - claddifying content as fit or not fit.

### Unsupervised Machine Learning
As in supervised learning the data is already labeled with y (the output), in contrast in unsupervised learning data is not labeled. The algorightm tries to find pattern within the data. One typical class of unsupervised learning is "Clustering" for example: Google news which cluster the realted articles together. 
Another class of unsupervised leatning is "Anomaly detection". Examples could be "Froud detection".
Unsupervised learning is also used for "Dimentionality Reduction" - compressing data to fewer data set without compromising the kowledge.
