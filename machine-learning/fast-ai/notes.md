# Fast.ai Notes - Chapter 1

## Key Concepts

### The fast.ai Approach
- Focus on practical coding first, then theory
- Use transfer learning for quick results
- Importance of "whole game" approach - start with complete working models

### Transfer Learning
- Using pre-trained models to leverage knowledge gained from other datasets
- Significantly reduces training time and data requirements
- Models like ResNet have been pre-trained on ImageNet (millions of images)

### The DataBlock API
- Flexible system for creating data pipelines
- Components:
  - `blocks`: Types of input and output (e.g., ImageBlock, CategoryBlock)
  - `get_items`: How to get the data items
  - `splitter`: How to split data into training and validation sets
  - `get_y`: How to get labels from items
  - `item_tfms`: Transformations applied to individual items
  - `batch_tfms`: Transformations applied to batches (like data augmentation)

### Fine-tuning
- Process of adapting a pre-trained model to a new dataset
- Typically involves:
  1. Freezing most of the pre-trained model
  2. Training just the last few layers on the new data
  3. Gradually unfreezing and training more layers

### Data Augmentation
- Technique to artificially increase dataset size
- Applies random transformations to images (rotation, flipping, lighting changes)
- Helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization

### Model Interpretation
- Using confusion matrices to understand model errors
- Examining most confused categories
- Viewing images with highest loss to understand difficult cases

### The Training Process
- Learning rate finder to determine optimal learning rates
- Discriminative learning rates (different layers use different rates)
- One-cycle policy for faster convergence
