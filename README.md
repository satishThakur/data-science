# Learning Data Science
This repository contains resources and code from my jouney to learn data science. I will cover following topics to start with:
* Summary of books and notes
* Code used to learn.
* Resources or chatsheets to learn concepts.

## Python
As Python is widely used as a programming language in DS landscape we will cover important topics to learn and master. Few of the needed skills in python are:
* ***NumPy*** - A library for scientific computation (numeric). Helpful in doing algebraic operations on vectors/metrics etc. Link - [link](https://github.com/satishThakur/data-science/blob/main/python-resources/numpy-cheatsheet.ipynb "NumPy Cheatsheet")
* ***Panda*** - 
* ***MathplotLib*** - Library for plotting and visualization of data.

## Machine Learning Libraries/Platforms

* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)

## Statastics and Visualization for Basic Data Analysis
* Descriptive Statstics
* EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualization

## Machine Learning
* [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://github.com/satishThakur/data-science/blob/main/machine-learning/ml-intro/notes.md)
* Supervised Learning
	- [Univariate Regression](https://github.com/satishThakur/data-science/blob/main/machine-learning/uni-regression/notes.md)
	- [Multiple Regression](https://github.com/satishThakur/data-science/blob/main/machine-learning/multi-regression/notes.md)
	- [Classification - Logistic Regression](https://github.com/satishThakur/data-science/blob/main/machine-learning/classification/notes.md) 
	- [Neural Networks](https://github.com/satishThakur/data-science/blob/main/machine-learning/neural-networks/nodes.md)
	- [Decision Trees]()
* Unsupervised Learing
	- [Clustering and Anomaly Detection]()
	- [Recomendation Systems]()
	- [Reinformcement Learning]

## TODO
* Structure the readme and link to different sections. This can generate documentation etc automatically.
