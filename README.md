# Learning Data Science
This repository contains resources and code from my jouney to learn data science. I will cover following topics to start with:
* Summary of books and notes
* Code used to learn.
* Resources or chatsheets to learn concepts.

## TODO
* Structure the readme and link to different sections. This can generate documentation etc automatically.
