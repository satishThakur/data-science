# Learning Data Science
This repository contains resources and code from my jouney to learn data science. I will cover following topics to start with:
* Summary of books and notes
* Code used to learn.
* Resources or chatsheets to learn concepts.

## Python
As Python is widely used as a programming language in DS landscape we will cover important topics to learn and master. Few of the needed skills in python are:
* NumPy - A library for scientific computation (numeric). Helpful in doing algebraic operations on vectors/metrics etc. Link - [link](https://github.com/satishThakur/data-science/blob/main/python-resources/numpy-cheatsheet.ipynb "NumPy Cheatsheet")

## TODO
* Structure the readme and link to different sections. This can generate documentation etc automatically.
