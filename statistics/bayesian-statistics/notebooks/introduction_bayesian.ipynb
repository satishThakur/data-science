    "# Basics of Bayesian Statistics.\n",
    "We would cover following key topics. A basic understanding of Probability Theory is assumed.\n",
    "## Probability, Statistics and Inference\n",
    "In probability theory we generally have probability of a event or events and from that we calculate probability of other derivations. For example given probability of coin toss being head is 0.5, what is probability of getting 4 heads in 10 tosses etc.\n",
    "But in real life we have observations and no probability - that is where Statistics comes in. We use statistical methods to derive probability of certain events. Hence in short statistics is probability in reverse.\n",
    "Once we have derived the probability we can make inferences about the data or certain aspects of the data. In this context finding the probability from data is called inference.\n",
    "## Topics to be covered here.\n",
    "- Binomial Distribution\n",
    "- Beta Distribution\n",
    "- PMF, PDF, CDF and their usage.\n",
    "- Prior, likelihood and posterior - Bayes' Theorem.\n",
    "- Using Bayes theorem to find confidence interval and contrast it with frequentist approach.\n",
    "- Prior conjugate - Binomial - Beta"
